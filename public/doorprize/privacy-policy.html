                <h4>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing</h4>
                <b>Automatically collected data:</b> IP address and browser
                characteristics are collected automatically when you visit this
                (or any other) web site. Like many other web sites, WheelOfNames.com
                uses Google Analytics. This product can identify you as a first-time
                or repeat visitor, the length of your visit, and similar.
                <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6004245?hl=en">Read
                more about Google Analytics data collection</a>.
                <br/>
                <b>Data you may choose to supply:</b> If you add names to the
                wheel by typing into the text-box, we will receive those names.
                If you import names from one of your spreadsheets, we will also
                receive those names, and the list of file names in your Google
                Drive account. If you choose to save a wheel by clicking the
                Save button, we store the names and settings for that wheel in
                Google Cloud Platform so you can retrieve them later by clicking
                the Open button. If you submit the feedback form, we receive all
                the data you have entered into that form.
                <br/>
                <b>How your data is used:</b> First, your data is used to fulfill
                your request. This means that we draw the names you entered on the
                wheel, or display the list of files from your Google Drive so
                that you can pick one of them. Second, we also use the data to
                improve the service by measuring user behavior on the web site.
                Most of these measurements are done in aggregate across many
                users, as allowed by Google Analytics. We also use the names you
                have entered on the wheel to understand what you are using the
                web site for and improve it for that use case. Third, if you
                submit an email address in the feedback form, we may use that
                email address to get back to you if we have follow-up questions
                on your feedback.
                <br/>
                <b>How your data is safeguarded:</b> Your data is stored in
                Google Analytics, Google Spreadsheets and Google Cloud Platform,
                under an account accessible only by Martin Omander. For details
                on how data is managed in those products by Google, see
                <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Google's privacy policy</a>.
                Your data is not shared, rented or sold to any other third
                parties.
                <br/><br/>
                <h4>Your Access to and Control Over Information</h4>
                You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You
                can do the following at any time by contacting us via
                support@omanderconsulting.com:

                <h4>Security</h4>
                We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit
                sensitive information via the website, your information is
                protected both online and offline.
                <br/>
                Wherever we collect sensitive information (such as email
                address), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in
                a secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in
                the address bar of your browser when accessing WheelOfNames.com.
                <br/>
                While we use encryption to protect sensitive information
                transmitted online, we also protect your information offline.
                Only the maintainer of this website (Martin Omander) has access
                to personally identifiable information. The computers in
                which we store personally identifiable information are kept in a
                <a href="https://www.google.com/about/datacenters/inside/data-security/index.html">secure
                Google data center</a>.
                <br/>
                If you feel that we are not abiding by this privacy policy, you
                should contact us immediately at support@omanderconsulting.com.
